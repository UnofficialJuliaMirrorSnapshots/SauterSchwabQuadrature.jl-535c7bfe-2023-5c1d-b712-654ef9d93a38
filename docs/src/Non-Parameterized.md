# Non-Parameterized


The called function in this implementation looks like:

`sauterschwabintegral(sourcechart, testchart, integrand, accuracy, accuracy_pd)`.

`sourcechart` and `testchart` can be created by

`testchart = simplex(P1,P2,P3); sourcechart = simplex(P4,P5,P6)`.

The order of the input arguments within the `simplex()` function does not matter.

`simplex()` generates the mapping and needs input arguments of type `SVector{3,Float64}`; the points P1 to P6 can be created by

`P = point(x,y,z)`.

`x`, `y` and `z` are the coordinates of that particular point and `point()` creates a position vector which is of type `SVector{3,Float64}`.

The `integrand` must be defined as a function with two input arguments; the input arguments must be 3D vectors. The name of this function is the input argument.

Later on, the last argument `accuracy` will be discussed.

Since `simplex()` and `point()` are functions of CompScienceMeshes, CompScienceMeshes does not just have to be installed on the user's machine, but also be available in the current workspace; the same applies for this package as well. The two packages can be made available by

`using SauterSchwabQuadrature` and `using CompScienceMeshes`.

These two commands must always be run at the beginning, if using this type of implementation.

`sauterschwabintegral()` first modifies `testchart` and `sourcechart` with respect to the order of the arguments, within their `simplex()` functions. Secondly, depending on how many vertices both charts have in common, it generates an object of some type that contains the information of the accuracy and the integration strategy. After all of this has been done, this function will call another function with input arguments of the two modified charts, the original integrand and that new object.

To understand the arguments `accuracy`, `accuracy_pd` and the examples stored in the examples folder, the 'another called function' will be presented next:





## Integration

According to item 1 on the homepage, four different constellations of the two triangles are possible:
* Equal triangles ``\to`` Common Face
* Two vertices in common ``\to`` Common Edge
* One vertex in common ``\to`` Common Vertex
* Both triangles do not touch at all ``\to`` Positive Distance

As each of those four constellations has its own integration method (because of a possible singularity in the kernel), the function `sauterschwabintegral()` has to call another function that handles the situation suitably; hence, it has four methods.

In the case `sauterschwabintegral()` has to deal with a situation of the first three cases, the two area-integrals will be transformed to four 1D integrals from zero to one; `accuracy` gives the number of quadrature points on that integration path, therefore, `accuracy` is of type unsigned Int64. In the case `sauterschwabintegral()` has to deal with a situation of the last case, `accuracy_pd`, which is again of type unsigned Int64, will be considered. It is a rule of how many quadrature points are created on both triangles. `accuracy_pd` =
* 1 ``\to`` 1
* 2 ``\to`` 3
* 3 ``\to`` 4
* 4 ``\to`` 6
* 5 ``\to`` 7
* 6 ``\to`` 12
* 7 ``\to`` 13
* 8 ``\to`` 36
* 9 ``\to`` 79
* 10 ``\to`` 105
* 11 ``\to`` 120
* 12 ``\to`` 400
* 13 ``\to`` 900
quadrature point(s) is(are) created on each triangle.  


The user is now able to understand the examples in the '...non_parameterized.jl' files, or rather their titles. The order of the points within the two `simplex()` functions of `Sourcechart` and `Testchart` can be changed arbitrarily, the result will always remain the same. For those, who are interested in the 'called function', or want to skip `sauterschwabintegral()` and call the integration directly, which is actually only a sorting process, may read on now.  

The called function by `sauterschwabintegral()` is:

`sauterschwab_nonparameterized(sourcechart, testchart, integrand, method)`.

`sourcechart` and `testchart` are the modified versions of the original charts; `integrand` is the same as at the beginning, and `method` is that created object. The type of `method` is responsible for what method of `sauterschwab_nonparameterized` is chosen. The four methods will be listed now:


### Common Face

 ``\Gamma`` and ``\Gamma'`` are equal; hence, `sourcechart` and `testchart` are equal as well. The two charts have to be created by

 `testchart = sourcechart = simplex(P1,P2,P3)`;

where, `P1`, `P2` and `P3` are the vertices of that particular triangle. Note, that both charts must be equal, which means that the first argument of both charts must be equal, the second argument of both charts must be equal, and the last argument of both charts must be equal.

 The last argument can be created by

`cf = CommonFace(x)`.

`cf` is an object of type `CommonFace()`; x is the number of quadrature points on the integration path ``[0,1]``.

An example for this case can be found at the end of the common_face_non_parameterized.jl file in the examples folder.






### Common Edge

``\Gamma`` and ``\Gamma'`` are now different; hence, `sourcechart` and `testchart` are different as well. The two charts have to be created in the following manner:

`testchart = simplex(P1,P2,P3); sourcechart = simplex(P1,P4,P3)`.

Again, the order of the input arguments must be taken into account: The first argument of both charts must be equal, and the last argument of both charts must be equal. Consequently, the first and the last argument are the vertices which both triangles have in common.

The last argument can be created by

`ce = CommonEdge(x)`.

`ce` is an object of type `CommonEdge()`; x is the number of quadrature points on the integration path ``[0,1]``.

An example for this case can be found at the end of the common_edge_non_parameterized.jl file in the examples folder.






### Common Vertex

The two triangles and charts are again different. The two charts have to be created in the following manner:

`sourcechart = simplex(P1,P2,P3); testchart = simplex(P1,P4,P5)`.

Again, the order of the input arguments must be taken into account: The first argument of both charts must be equal, the order of `P2` and `P3` with respect to `sourcechart`, and the order of `P4` and `P5` with respect to `testchart`, does not matter.  Consequently, the first argument is the vertex both triangles have in common.

The last argument is created by

`cv = CommonVertex(x)`.

`cv` is an object of type `CommonVertex()`; x is the number of quadrature points on the integration path ``[0,1]``.

An example for this case can be found at the end of the common_vertex_non_parameterized.jl file in the examples folder.






### Positive Distance

As the triangles do not touch at all, the integration can directly be calculated with GaussÂ´s quadrature. Therefore, the order of the arguments within the two `simplex()` functions do not matter.

The last argument can be created by

`pd = PositiveDistance(x)`.

`pd` is an object of type `PositiveDistance()`; x is the rule of how many quadrature points are created on both triangles.

An example for this case can be found at the end of the positive_distance_non_parameterized.jl file in the examples folder.
